## ðŸ”§ 1. FIR filter equation

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{M-1} h[k] \, x[n-k]
$$

* \$h\[k]\$ are the **FIR coefficients** (taps).
* This is literally a **convolution** of the input \$x\[n]\$ with kernel \$h\[k]\$.

## âš¡ 2. FIR as Neural Network

* **Layer type:** Conv1d with kernel size = filter length, stride=1, no padding.
* **Weights:** the convolution kernel is the FIR filter taps.
* **Trainable:** autograd will learn optimal taps from data.

So a FIR filter is basically a **single Conv1d layer with linear activation**.

## ðŸ§© 3. PyTorch FIR-NN Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class FIRLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, filter_len=16):
        super().__init__()
        # FIR taps as learnable parameters
        self.taps = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, filter_len) * 0.01)

    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch, 1, time)
        y = F.conv1d(x, self.taps, stride=1, padding=0)
        return y
```

Usage:

```python
fir = FIRLayer(filter_len=32)
x = torch.randn(1, 1, 1024)   # 1 batch, mono audio, 1024 samples
y = fir(x)
loss = y.abs().mean()
loss.backward()  # gradients flow into taps
```

## ðŸŽ› 4. Extensions

* **Multichannel:** use `groups` in Conv1d for stereo or multi-band FIRs.
* **Stacking:** multiple FIR layers = deeper linear filters.
* **Nonlinear FIR-NN:** add ReLUs or tanh between FIR layers for nonlinear filtering.
* **Hybrid:** combine FIR layers with differentiable IIR (biquads) for full DSP-NN hybrids.
* **Conditioning:** make taps depend on another input (e.g. MIDI, text, images) â†’ adaptive FIR-NN.

âœ… Conclusion:
A **FIR-NN** is just a **convolutional layer with learnable taps**. The cool part is that in deep learning frameworks, you get autograd, GPU acceleration, and the ability to **learn entire filterbanks** as part of a larger system (e.g. DDSP).

Would you like me to design a **trainable FIR filterbank layer** (like a differentiable graphic EQ with N bands, each FIR-learned)?
